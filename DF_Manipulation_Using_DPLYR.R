# The summarise function is used to summarise multiple values into a single value. It is very powerful when used in conjunction with the other functions in the dplyr package, as demonstrated below. na.rm = TRUE will remove all NA values while calculating the mean, so that it doesnâ€™t produce spurious results.
df_new = df %>% summarise(mean(var1, na.rm = TRUE))


# The group_by function is used to group data by one or more variables.
df_new = df %>% group_by(var2) %>% summarise(mean(var1, na.rm = TRUE))
